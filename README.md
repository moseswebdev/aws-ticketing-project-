This is a sample online ticketing system built in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates:

- Generating and processing tickets from CSV
- Categorizing tickets and assigning priority
- Generating AI-powered suggested responses
- Interactive dashboard to filter tickets, mark as resolved, and export unresolved tickets
- Visualizations for ticket insights

## Features

1. Auto-generate sample tickets
2. Assign category, priority, and suggested responses
3. Interactive dashboard using `ipywidgets`
4. Export unresolved tickets to CSV
5. Visual analytics using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `tickets.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
4. Run the cells step by step to see the workflow
